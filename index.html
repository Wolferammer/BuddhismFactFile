            <h2>When and Why Did Buddhism Begin?</h2>
            <p>Buddhism began over 2,500 years ago in ancient India. It was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, later known as the Buddha, who sought to understand the causes of human suffering and find a path to liberation. Siddhartha renounced his royal life and worldly pleasures to seek enlightenment, eventually sharing his teachings to help others achieve freedom from suffering.</p>

            <h2>How Can Suffering Be Ended According to the Buddha?</h2>
            <p>The Buddha taught that suffering (dukkha) can be ended by following the Noble Eightfold Path. This path includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. By practising these principles, individuals can overcome ignorance and desire, which are the root causes of suffering, and achieve enlightenment (nirvana).</p>

            <h2>Is Buddhism a Religion?</h2>
            <p>Some argue that Buddhism is not a religion because it does not involve worship of a deity or adherence to a single divine figure. Instead, it is often seen as a philosophy or way of life focused on self-realisation and ethical living. However, many believe Buddhism is a religion because it involves a structured set of beliefs and practices, such as the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, which guide its followers.</p>
            <p>I believe Buddhism is a religion because a religion encompasses the beliefs and practices of a group of people. Buddhism fits this definition as it is based on the belief that life involves suffering and that liberation is possible through the Eightfold Path. Moreover, Buddhism provides a moral framework and community for its practitioners, fulfilling both spiritual and societal roles akin to other religions.</p>

            <h2>Important Symbols in Buddhism</h2>
            <p>Two important symbols in Buddhism are the Dharma Wheel (Dharmachakra) and the Lotus Flower. The Dharma Wheel represents the teachings of the Buddha and the path to enlightenment. Its eight spokes symbolise the Noble Eightfold Path. The Lotus Flower signifies purity and spiritual awakening. It grows in muddy waters but remains untainted, representing the potential for enlightenment despite life's challenges.</p>

            <h2>Qualities That Buddhists Strive to Develop</h2>
            <p>Buddhists aim to cultivate three essential qualities: compassion (karuna), wisdom (prajna), and mindfulness (sati). Compassion involves understanding and alleviating the suffering of others. Wisdom refers to gaining insight into the nature of reality, especially the impermanence of life. Mindfulness helps individuals remain focused and present, enabling them to make thoughtful and ethical choices.</p>

            <h2>The Cause of Suffering According to Buddhism</h2>
            <p>According to Buddhist teachings, the primary cause of suffering is attachment or craving (tanha). This craving arises from ignorance (avidya) and leads to desires for material possessions, pleasure, and continued existence. By understanding and letting go of these attachments, individuals can break the cycle of suffering and attain enlightenment.</p>
